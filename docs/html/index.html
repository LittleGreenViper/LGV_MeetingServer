<p><img src="icon.png" alt="The Project Icon" class="inline"/></p>
<p>This is a general-purpose aggregator server for various meeting lists.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer">The source code is available at this GitHub repo.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://littlegreenviper.com/LGV_MeetingServer/Tests/">This is a Live Example (Test Harness)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingSDK">The LGV_MeetingSDK</a> is a generic Apple platform SDK that consumes this server.</p>
<h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>The server is designed to allow you to write "modules," that can connect to multiple servers, and reformat their meeting data, into a common format, which can then be read as a "unified" set, in a common format.</p>
<p>The aggregator maintains a very simple SQL database, with a defined format (regardless of the format of its origins). Queries are then executed against that data.</p>
<h2>Reading the Data Into the System</h2>
<p>Most of the "work" happens in the "gathering" service, which is triggered at regular intervals. Each "module" reads the servers that it is responsible for, and conditions that server's unique format, to the common format for the aggregator.</p>
<h2>Querying the Data</h2>
<p>Most of the "action," happens when the database is queried. There are a number of table columns that can be queried (more on that, in a bit), and the response is always returned as optimized JSON (also, more on that, in a bit). This is designed as a simple semantic data source, and is not meant for immediate display to users.</p>
<h1>What Is the Data?</h1>
<p>Glad you asked. This has been designed specifically, as an aggregator and façade, for regularly-occurring (weekly), repeating events. It supports both geographically-centered events ("in-person"), and "virtual" events (or combinations of both).</p>
<p>The events, in the initial phase of this project, are 12-Step Recovery organization meetings; notably, <a href="https://na.org">NA</a> meetings. It has been designed to allow other types of meetings to be added to the database, as well.</p>
<p>The database is queried using the default language for every server, so expect servers based in France, to have their data in French.</p>
<h2>Meeting Time Data</h2>
<p>Each meeting has columns that represent a start time (given in seconds, since midnight), a duration (also in seconds), and a weekday (1-7, with 1 always Sunday).</p>
<h2>Meeting Location Data</h2>
<p>If the meeting is an "in-person" meeting, there is a "physical location," associated with it. This has fairly standard address components. Also, the main table row has a longitude column, and a latitude column, for geographic searches. These columns are NULL, if the meeting is virtual-only.</p>
<h2>Virtual Meeting Information</h2>
<p>If the meeting has a virtual component (or is a virtual-only meeting), there will be an array associated, with the information for that virtual meeting, like a URL, phone number, meeting ID, password, etc.</p>
<h2>Meeting Format Data</h2>
<p>Each meeting has an atomic "formats" array, containing a simple breakdown of the formats for the meeting.</p>
<h1>Query types</h1>
<p>The query format is not a "comprehensive" search. It is designed to give a "quick and dirty" triage of the data, and we expect the query consumer to apply a more refined filtering and organization of the data. The main purpose of this server, is to provide a manageable found set, for more specific, and application-dependent processing.</p>
<p>There are three basic ways to query the database:</p>
<h2>Direct (Raw) Queries.</h2>
<p>These have no implicit filtering, and an empty direct query will return the entire database (which can be quite large).</p>
<h2>Geographic Queries</h2>
<p>These are queries that are focused on a specific location, given by a longitude/latitude (in degrees) pair. It is possible to have a fixed radius, where all the meetings that are geolocated within the circle around the center, are returned, or an "auto" radius, where an expanding radius is repeatedly executed, until a specified number of results has been found.</p>
<h2>Individual ID Queries</h2>
<p>These queries provide a set of meeting IDs (which consist of a server ID, and a local meeting ID -more on that, later). Further filtering can be done on the set, but only meetings specifically referenced will be available for the search.</p>
<p>It is possible to have limited "wildcard" ID searches, where all the meetings provided by a particular source server, are provided as the initial found set. More on that, in a bit.</p>
<p>IDs are added to the search, in an "OR" fashion. Most of the filters are applied in an "AND" fashion.</p>
<h1>Query Filtering</h1>
<p>Each of the above queries can have filters applied, which will affect/narrow the found set of meetings.</p>
<h2>Geofence</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, a geofence can be applied to a query, restricting the found set to a radius around a center. This will not return "pure virtual" meetings, which do not have a location.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Each meeting is designated to be part of an "organization," which is applied by the module that read the meeting from its origin server. Currently, there are only two "organizations": "na," and "virtual-na," with the former being in-person NA meetings, and the latter being "pure virtual" (no physical location) meetings.</p>
<p>Organizations are not specific to any single source server. Multiple servers can provide data that is tagged as belonging to an organization.</p>
<h2>Meeting Type Queries</h2>
<p>The type of meeting (physical, virtual, or combinations, thereof), can be filterd.</p>
<h2>Weekday</h2>
<p>Each meeting is designated as gathering weekly, on a specific day. 1 is always Sunday (regardless of the locale week start), and 7 is always Saturday. Multiple weekdays can be applied, in an "OR" fashion.</p>
<h2>Start Time Window</h2>
<p>You can filter for meetings that start on or after a certain time, or that start before, or at, a certain time. Both can be applied, so you can have a "time window" for meeting starts.</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Server Technology Stack.</h2>
<p>The server is written in very basic <a href="https://php.net">PHP</a>. Its initial implementaion is designed for a <a href="https://mysql.com">MySQL</a> database server, but the server uses <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php">PDO</a>, and modifying to use other types of servers (like <a href="https://postgresql.org">Postgres</a>), should be fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>The database, itself, is absurdly simple. It just has one single data table, with each row being an atomic entity, representing one meeting. There are no relations. There is also a "meta" table, that is used to track the last update time, so that updates occur regularly.</p>
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>There's very little, in the way of security risks, with the server. The most sensitive information, is the database login information. No user PID is kept.</p>
<p>The configuration file, which contains the databse information, can be stored outside the HTTP directory. It is referenced by an <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php"><code>include(...)</code></a> function.</p>
<h2>Setting Up the Server</h2>
<p>You'll need to have about the same kind of "raw materials" as you would need, to set up a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/before-you-install/">WordPress</a> server: A MySQL database, and a PHP server that is running late-version (8.0 or greater is recommended, but it will probably work fine with 7.4) PHP.</p>
<p>Most of the server files can be stored outside the HTTP path. They are all included. The only file that needs to be in the HTTP path, is the entrypoint file that you write. An example, is the <a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer/blob/master/Tests/entrypoint.php"><code>entrypoint.php</code></a> file, in the testing directory of the project.</p>
<p>In your entrypoint file, you'll need to declare <code>$config_file_path</code> as a global variable, and set it to reference the configuration file: </p><pre class="fragment">global $config_file_path;
$config_file_path = '&lt; PATH TO CONFIG FILE &gt;';
</pre><p> You will then need to include the <code><a class="el" href="a00002.html">LGV_MeetingServer_Entrypoint.php</a></code> file of the server, from the source directory: </p><pre class="fragment">define( 'LGV_MeetingServer_Files', 1 );
require_once('&lt; PATH TO SERVER DIRECTORY &gt;/Sources/LGV_MeetingServer_Entrypoint.php');
</pre><p> That's all you need to do. If the configuration file is set up correctly, the server will set itself up, the first time an update is run. You should have one successful update performed, before applying queries.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer/blob/master/Tests/config/LGV_MeetingServer-Config.php">Here is a sample config file.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer/blob/master/Tests/entrypoint.php">Here is a sample entrypoint file.</a></p>
<p>Note that the <code>LGV_MeetingServer_Files</code> macro is declared (and set to 1). This is a simple macro that prevents individual files from being run, unless they are part of the hierarchy, defined by the entrypoint.</p>
<h1>Server API</h1>
<p>This is the explicit server API. The server is not a traditional "CRUD" server. It's a very simple "call and response" server, with calls being GET HTTP requests, and responses being simple JSON (or HTTP headers, if there's an issue).</p>
<h2>The Calling URI</h2>
<p>Each call to the server will have a structure like so (this is just an example): </p><pre class="fragment">https://meetingserver/entrypoint.php?query&amp;page_size=100&amp;page=3&amp;weekdays=2,3,4,5,6
</pre><p> Here's a simple breakdown: </p><pre class="fragment">https://meetingserver/entrypoint.php   ?   query     &amp;page_size=100&amp;page=3&amp;weekdays=2,3,4,5,6
↖                                  ↗       ↖   ↗     ↖                                      ↗
            The Base URL                  Function                Query Parameters
</pre> <h3>The Base URL</h3>
<p>This will be the hostname and path, directly to the PHP file that will act as the entry point to the server. You will create this file, and it will have the structure prescribed, above.</p>
<p>After that, will be the question mark delimiter, and the Function will be assigned.</p>
<h3>The Function</h3>
<p>This indicates the server function that we are invoking. It can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>query</b> This will be the function invoked most often. It queries the database, and expects meeting data to be returned as JSON. There are a number of possible parameters, that will be defined, below.</li>
<li><b>info</b> This asks the server to return a JSON object that defines some basic server structure, like the number of meetings, organizations, and even module servers. There are no parameters to this call.</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>update</b> This gives the server execution thread, to perform an update of its data. Unless forced, calls with this function will usually end with a "204 No Content" success code (a JSON object is returned, if an update was performed). There are only three parameters to this call:</p>
<p class="startli"><code><a href="https://meetingserver/entrypoint.php?update">https://meetingserver/entrypoint.php?update</a>&amp;force&amp;physical_only&amp;separate_virtual</code></p><ul>
<li><em>force</em> This means that the server should run the update, even if the elapsed time, specified in the config file, has not passed. The last update time will be changed to reflect this update.</li>
<li><em>physical_only</em> This means that "pure virtual" meetings will be ignored, and only meetings with a physical presence will be added. If <code>separate_virtual</code> is defined, then this is ignored.</li>
<li><em>separate_virtual</em> This means that any "pure virtual" meetings encountered, will be read, but assigned a different organization key (in this case, "virtual-na").</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> If no <code>physical_only</code> (-p, for CLI) or <code>separate_virtual</code> (-sv) is presented, <em>the entire server databse</em> (both physical <em>and</em> virtual) is read, and stored as a single organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Query Response</h3>
<p>Each query will result in a JSON response, consisting of two parts: <code>meta</code>, and <code>meetings</code>. <code>meta</code> is a JSON object, with some basic information about the query and the response, and <code>meetings</code> is an array of JSON objects, representing each meeting.</p>
<h3>Query Parameters</h3>
<p>These are the refinements to the command requested by the <code>"query"</code> function.</p>
<p><a href="https://littlegreenviper.com/LGV_MeetingServer/Tests/">The Live Test Page has examples of these.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Paging</b></p>
<p class="startli">It is possible to "page" large query responses. This is the process of breaking up a very large response, into discrete "chunks." For example, if a query returned 3,000 meetings, it could be a lot of memory overhead to parse that much JSON, and you could also tie up the connection for a long time. That could be a problem, if there was "spotty" Internet service.</p>
<p class="startli">Instead, what we do, is ask the server to break the response into "pages," and send us only the portion of the whole that is on a given "page."</p>
<p class="startli">For example, we could break the 3,000 meeting response into 30 pages of 100 meetings, then ask for Page 0 (0 ... 99), Page 1 (100 ... 199), Page 2 (200 ... 299), etc.</p><ul>
<li><em>page_size</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is the size of each page. It is 1-based. In the above example, this would be 100. </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>&zwj;NOTE: If you set this to 0, then no actual results will be returned, and the <code>meta</code> property will contain the number of meetings that would be returned, if it were not zero. If you do not send this query argument, then the results will not be paged.</p><ul>
<li><em>page</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is which page to send. It is 0-based, so the pages are numbered as <code>0..&lt;ceil(total_meetings/page_size)</code>, in range nomenclature. If <code>page_size</code> is not provided, or is 0, this is ignored. Leaving this query argument out, results in page 0 being returned (or all of the data, if <code>page_size</code> is also left out, or larger than the complete meeting query response size).</p>
<p><b>Just Getting the Paging Metrics</b></p>
<p>If you specify a <code>page_size</code> of 0, then only the "metrics" of the query response will be returned (how many meetings).</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>- <b>Organization Parameters</b></p>
<p class="startli">We can search for meetings that have certain organization keys.</p><ul>
<li><em>org_key</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is a string, and specifies the organization we are filtering for. We can specify multiple values, separated by commas (,). Examples might be <code>org_key=na</code> (in-person NA meetings only), <code>org_key=virtual-na</code> (virtual NA meetings only), or <code>org_key=na,virtual-na</code> (both in-person, and virtual, NA meetings).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Geographic Parameters</b></p>
<p class="startli">You can search the database, based on a geographic center, and a prescribed (or implied) radius, around that center.</p><ul>
<li><em>geocenter_lng</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is the longitude of the geographic center. It is in degrees, as a floating-point number (-180.0 -&gt; 180.0). If provided, you must also provide <code>geocenter_lat</code>.</p><ul>
<li><em>geocenter_lat</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is the latitude of the geographic center. It is in degrees, as a floating-point number (-90.0 -&gt; 90.0). If provided, you must also provide <code>geocenter_lng</code>.</p>
<p class="startli">Specifying these two coordinates will define a geographic search, but you still need to provide <b>at least one</b> of the following two parameters, in order to complete the geographic search specification:</p><ul>
<li><em>geo_radius</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is the radius of the search, as a fixed value, so every meeting that has its long/lat coordinates within this circle, will be returned. It is in kilometers, specified as a floating-point number.</p>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> If you specify this, along with <code>minimum_found</code>, then this will be the maximum radius possible for an auto-radius search. If not provided, the maximum radius will be 10,000 Km.</p><ul>
<li><em>minimum_found</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This will be a positive integer value, and will specify a "target" number of meetings to be found, by increasing the radius around the center, in steps, until at least this many meetings are found. The final radius will be returned in the "meta" object, in the search results.</p>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> In most cases, this will be <em><b>at least</b></em> the number of meetings found, but, occasionally, there may be a few meetings not included. That is because there is a small amount of "slop" in the radius calculations.</p>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> This minimum number will be applied <em><b>after</b></em> the other filter parameters, so, for example, if you are looking only for meetings on the weekend, the final radius is likely to be larger, than if you search for meetings that gather on any day.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Meeting Type Parameters</b></p>
<p class="startli">There are basically four different choices, as to the meeting type. These are represented as integer values of the <code>type</code> query parameter.</p><ul>
<li><em>All Meetings (Regardless of type)</em> (0) This is default, if no <code>type</code> parameter is provided.</li>
<li><em>Virtual and Physical (hybrid)</em> (-1, or 1)</li>
<li><em>Virtual Only</em> (-2)</li>
<li><em>Physical Only</em> (2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Time And Day Parameters</b></p>
<p class="startli">We have the ability to filter for meetings that occur only on certain weekdays, or that begin at certain times of the day. Times are integers (0 - 86399), given in seconds from midnight, this morning (00:00:00), and weekdays are integers (1-7) always 1 = Sunday, and 7 = Saturday, regardless of when the week starts, locally. You can specify more than one weekday (they are used in an "OR" fashion), and times are always <em>start</em> times (duration of a meeting is not taken into account).</p><ul>
<li><em>weekdays</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This is one or more integers (1-7), separated by commas (,), if more than one weeekday is specified. An example of Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday would be <code>weekdays=1,3,5</code>. In that case, any meeting that gathered on any of these days would be included, and meetings that gathered on other days, would be excluded.</p><ul>
<li><em>start_time</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This means that meetings that start at, or after, the given time (seconds from midnight, this morning 0 - 86399), will be included in the found set.</p>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> If <code>end_time</code> is specified, <code>end_time</code> must be greater than <code>start_time</code>, or it will be ignored (<code>start_time</code> is dominant).</p><ul>
<li><em>end_time</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This means that meetings that start at, or before, the given time (seconds from midnight, this morning 0 - 86399), will be included in the found set.</p>
<p class="startli">&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> If <code>start_time</code> is specified, <code>end_time</code> must be greater than <code>start_time</code>, or it will be ignored (<code>start_time</code> is dominant).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Individual (And Server) Meeting IDs</b></p>
<p class="startli">It is possible to filter out an explicit (or "wildcard") IDs for meetings.</p><ul>
<li><em>ids</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This will have integer pairs, given as "`(&lt;SERVER ID&gt;,&lt;MEETING ID&gt;)`". The parentheses are required, as is the <code>&lt;SERVER ID&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;MEETING ID&gt;</code> is optional. If not provided, or set to 0 (or a non-integer chracter, such as "*"), then all meetings on that server are included in the found set. If provided, but the meeting is not available at that ID, the ID is considered invalid, and does not apply.</p>
<p class="startli">These can be specified as multiple values, separated by commas (,). For example: <code>ids=(99,10),(99,11)</code> will target two meetings, on one server. <code>ids=(99,10),(100,10)</code> will target two meetings, on two different servers.</p>
<p class="startli"><b>Server IDs and Meeting IDs</b></p>
<p class="startli">Every server that is queried for meetings, has a <code>server_id</code> column, which is a 1-based, positive integer ID, that is unique (but repeated for every meeting table row for that server). Every meeting has a <code>meeting_id</code> table column, which is unique, on the meeting's server. Between the two values, each meeting has a unique identifier on the <code>LGV_MeetingServer</code> database server, and specifying "`(&lt;SERVER ID&gt;,&lt;MEETING ID&gt;)`" will target exactly one meeting row.</p>
<p class="startli"><b>Wildcards</b></p>
<p class="startli">It is possible to specify "all the meetings provided by this server", by specifying only the <code>server_id</code> value. For exaple: <code>ids=(99)</code>, <code>ids=(99,0)</code>, <code>ids=(99,*)</code> all specify every meeting on the server identified by an ID of 99. <code>ids=(99),(100)</code> Will specify all the IDs in servers 99, and 100. Any servers and/or meetings, not mentioned in the <code>ids</code> parameter, will not be included in the found set.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Response Data</h2>
<p>Data will always be returned as an optimized <a href="https://json.org">JSON</a> object, with various formats, depending upon the request. If a field has no value, it is generally not included.</p>
<p>Here are the schemas for the various responses, assigned to the function:</p>
<h3><code>update</code></h3>
<p>&gt;<b>NOTE:</b> It is possible to prevent the <code>update</code> function from working from the HTTP invocation (only available via command line). This is so that we can regulate the updates, via things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron"><code>cron</code></a> tasks. This is done by setting the <code>$_use_cli_only_for_update</code> variable to <code>true</code>, in <a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer/blob/master/Tests/config/LGV_MeetingServer-Config.php">the configuration file</a>.</p>
<p>If an update is successful, it will return a response like so:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">  &quot;number_of_meetings&quot;: 32790,</div>
<div class="line">  &quot;time_in_seconds&quot;: 55.877379179001</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>number_of_meetings</code> value is the total number of meetings process, from all servers, in all services, and available for searching.</p>
<p>The <code>time_in_seconds</code> value, is how long it took, to run the operation.</p>
<p>If the update is ignored (like the elapsed time period, specified by the variable <code>$_updateIntervalInSeconds</code>, in <a href="https://github.com/LittleGreenViper/LGV_MeetingServer/blob/master/Tests/config/LGV_MeetingServer-Config.php">the configuration file</a>, has not passed, no output is returned (You get <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204">an HTTP 204</a> response).</p>

<p><code>php &lt;PATH TO DIRECTORY&gt;/entrypoint.php cli &lt;ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS&gt;</code></p>
